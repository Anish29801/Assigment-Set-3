### These assigments taught me the basics of DOM Manipulation. These Mini Project gave me a lot of confidence. These Project showed how to take input from user from user and how to process the input to give an proper and user friendly output. It's very powerful that the program can write something and read user input.

#### This Program reads user input from textbox and onclick on Convert button it converts the case of the words entered into:
* Camel-Case
* Pascal-Case
* Snake-Case
* Screaming-Snake-Case
* Kabeb-Case
* Screaming-Kabeb-Case

## * Color Changer

#### This Program generates random color on a button click it generates a hex code and change the body property of color in css using js.

## * Joke Generator
#### This project is one of my favourite. It generators a silly joke each time you click the button. It taught me how to handle api and process the data using promises.
