### These assigments taught me the basics of DOM Manipulation. These Mini Project gave me a lot of confidence. These Project showed how to take input from user from user and how to process the input to give an proper and user friendly output. It's very powerful that the program can write something and read user input.

## * Name-Conversion
#### This Program reads user input from textbox and onclick on Convert button it converts the case of the words entered into:
* Camel-Case
* Pascal-Case
* Snake-Case
* Screaming-Snake-Case
* Kabeb-Case
* Screaming-Kabeb-Case

## * Color Changer

#### This Program generates random color on a button click it generates a hex code and change the body property of color in css using js.

## * Joke Generator
#### This project is one of my favourite. It generators a silly joke each time you click the button. It taught me how to handle api and process the data using promises.

## * Age-Calculator
#### This project uses vanilla javascript to calculate the age of a person and then it converts it to years, days and months. This was a fun simple project to do and #### learn to manage date input from the user. If an error is encountered either a person enters the date in future the program can handle it as well.

## * Counter App
#### This is a counter app that on pressing + increases the value and on pressing - will decrease the value. The counter only works for values greater than -1 either  #### on pressing - on 0 nothing will happen. This Javascript project was a good practice of dom manipulation and of writing basic functions.

 ## * Click The Button 
 #### This is a counter-like app that counters the times the button is hit. It displays it on the screen.


## * See What you Type
#### This app displays what you type in the textbox in real-time.  It continuously listens to the typing outputting in the space. It was fun as the function needed both reading and writing at the same time.
